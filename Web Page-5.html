        <H2>Christmas is the most pious festival of Christians, but it is celebrated across the world now-a-days irrespective of caste and class. It is celebrated as the birthday of the Lord Jesus Christ, who taught everyone to live a virtuous life. Though it is true that no human being is perfect and people tend to make mistakes almost every moment which causes misunderstanding and disharmony amongst people; but Jesus taught people to follow the path of forgiveness. He assured that whosoever seeks him shall find him. People who follow Christianity follow the path of Jesus Christ and celebrate Christmas festival with great zeal and enthusiasm.</H2>
