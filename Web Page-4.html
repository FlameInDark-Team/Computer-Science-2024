        <H2>Holi is the festival of colors celebrated with our loved ones. It is one of the biggest festivals in our country which comes every year during March. Children, adults and even the elder citizens take part in the fun and preparations of Holi for three days starting from a full moon day. People from all religions play Holi by exchanging sweets, gujiya, thandai and splashing colors on each other. Water guns and water balloons are also used by children during the Holidays. This is a time to share love and happiness with our friends and family. People should always remember to use natural colors to keep themselves and their guests healthy and safe during Holi.</H2>
