        <H2>Eid is a special festival for Muslims all around the world. It comes twice a year and is full of joy and happiness. The first Eid is called Eid al-Fitr, and it is celebrated at the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting. On this day, people wear new clothes, give gifts, and share delicious foods. The second Eid, called Eid al-Adha, means ‘Festival of Sacrifice’. It remembers a story about Prophet Ibrahim. On this day, people share food with the poor. Both Eids bring families and friends together. They are about sharing, caring, and giving thanks.</H2>
